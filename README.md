# TELECOM-CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION  

## Introduction  
This repository focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry.  
Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to the situation when customers discontinue using a company's product or service.  
The ability to identify customers at risk of churn can help companies implement targeted retention strategies, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  

This project draws inspiration from the following Kaggle notebooks:  
[CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION - bhartiprasad17](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhartiprasad17/customer-churn-prediction)

### About Customer Churn  
Customer churn refers to the discontinuation of a company's product or service by its customers.  
It is crucial to identify and predict customer churn to focus retention efforts on high-risk clients.  
This project aims to develop a holistic view of customers and their interactions across various channels to detect early signs of potential churn.  

### About the Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [IBM Sample Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  
It contains information about customers who have left within the last month and their associated attributes.  
The dataset includes details about the services customers have signed up for, customer account information, and demographic information.  
The target variable, "Churn", indicates whether a customer has churned or not.  

## Loading Libraries and Data  
This section covers the necessary steps to load the required libraries and the dataset for analysis.  

## Understanding the Data  
An exploration of the dataset is conducted to gain insights into its structure, features, and relationships.  

## Visualize Missing Values  
Visualizing missing values helps identify any gaps in the dataset that need to be addressed before further analysis.  

## Data Manipulation  
This section focuses on data manipulation techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming data as required.  

## Data Visualization  
Data visualization techniques are applied to gain visual insights and understand the relationships between different variables.  

## Data Preprocessing  
The data preprocessing stage involves scaling, splitting into training and testing sets, and any additional preprocessing steps required for model training.  

## Machine Learning Model Evaluations and Predictions  
Multiple machine learning models are evaluated and compared to predict customer churn.  
This section includes the implementation and evaluation of various models, such as Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Voting Classifier.  

## Advice  
Based on feature selection and model refinement, recommendations are provided for optimizing customer retention strategies.  
The advice includes insights on excluding certain features and not implementing differential pricing based on gender.  
By following these recommendations, the company can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.  

## Notes  
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of telecom customer churn prediction and guide companies in developing effective customer retention strategies.
